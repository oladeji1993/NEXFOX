DESIGN METHODOLOGY 

Our design process begins mostly in the field. 
We visit and examine the site to understand its settings both 
geographically and environmentally, and what we find gives us ideas of 
what is possible and what would be limitations. All our discoveries plus 
our clients specifications sends 

our minds and hands to work. This is where we come up with various design concepts which we go over with our clients.
 And once a selection is made, we immediately enter the creation process. At this stage, 
 our various members with their different specialization collaborate in offering their expertise throughout the phases of the project, 
 from in-house design conceptualization to on-site construction supervision.  
Architect, Ben Chuks, and Engineer, Union Arekhandia co-founded Peak Designs Concept in 2005. We are a group of architects, engineers 
and fabricators that specializes in conceptualizing and delivering high-class, modern and future-looking architectural designs and solutions, 
as well as manage building projects.
